First Brainstorm: Hector and I decided to roll with the course recommendation application idea. The goal is to build a website that allows students to easily find and schedule courses based on their preferences using natural language. Currently, to sign up for a course, students need to spend hours browsing through the course catalog, matching that with course explorer and the sections offered, and then finding out about professor ratings and gpa disparity through other third-party resources. Our plan is to congregate all of that data into an application, and then attach a chatbot interface that can be used to efficiently search and schedule courses. We also want to develop an interactive UI that will display tentative schedules similar to how they would appear in schedule generator.

We are going to conduct some preliminary research this week and meet on Friday to decide how to plan out work for the project
